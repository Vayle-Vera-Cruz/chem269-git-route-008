EXERCISE 3: THE REJECTION

Error Message:
$ git push
To https://github.com/Vayle-Vera-Cruz/chem269-git-route-008.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Vayle-Vera-Cruz/chem269-git-route-008.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.

What is Git protecting?
Git is protecting the version of the file that was last pushed and making sure that edits and saves arent made unchecked from different people.

Why doesn't Git just overwrite the remote?
Git wants the end user to determine which version we want to keep. Either partner A and partner B and since we both made edits in the same lines of code, it wants us to decide for ourselfs which edits we want to keep.
